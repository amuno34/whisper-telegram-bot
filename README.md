# Whisper AI powered Telegram Bot
Speech to Text Telegram bot using the Whisper AI model made by OpenAI.

## TO DO:
- Port the code to a newer version of python-telegram-bot
- Get around the 50MB download limit that the Telegram API imposes
- Optimize the code in general
- Getting the LOGMMSE algorithm working for audios with a lot of noise
- <s>Create a requirement.txt file for ease of use</s>
- Making a better documentation

## Setting up
Download the repository as a .zip file and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
The requirements file installs even the LOGMMSE package if you want to have fun with it.

## Running the bot
Just change the `PUT_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in the `TOKEN` variable with the bot token you created with Botfather.

Then with Python just run the `main.py` file.

## Contributions
I will read and test almost all the contributions you make.

## Special thanks
